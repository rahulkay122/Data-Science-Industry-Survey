# Introduction

The Data Science Industry Survey Analysis project aims to provide a comprehensive examination of the current landscape, trends, and challenges within the data science industry. By conducting a thorough survey targeting data science professionals and organizations, this project seeks to uncover valuable insights to inform strategic decision-making and industry best practices.

# Tools Used

* Excel: Primary Data Cleaning
* PowerBi: Data Transformation, Modeling and Visualizations

# Research Questions
1. How does the demand for specific programming languages (e.g., Python, R, SQL) vary across different sectors or industries within the data science field?
2. What are some job factors that contribute to job satisfaction and retention among data science professionals?
3. What is the impact of a university degree in data science on the salary? 
4. How does the salary of the data professional defer based on sex, age and ethnicity? 

# Cleaning Procedures

The data underwent rigorous cleaning processes, including:
* Removing duplicates and handling missing values.
* Standardizing the format of categorical variables and converting data types for numerical analysis.
* Ensuring geographic data accuracy for subsequent geospatial analysis.
* Aggregating data where necessary to facilitate more efficient analysis.
* Creating a consistent naming convention for ease of interpretation and analysis.
